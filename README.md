# Ansible tutorial

Tutorial for ansible, following Jay LaCroix  

# Introduction  
Install openssh-server on servers.  
Install openssh-client on ansible server.  
Generate personal key, password protected and ansible key with out password on the ansible servers. Install public keys on the servres.  
Install git on ansible server.  
config git, e.g.  
git config --global user.name "full name"  
git config --global user.email  full@name.se  
Linux:  
git config --global core.autocrlf input
or create a .gitattributes file in project root..  
Create repository, e.g either on github or own git server.  
Install public password Ã¥protected key in git repository server.
SSH clone repository. Change to git project  

Created inventory of hosts  
Created ansible.cfg:  
nano ansible.cfg   

    [defaults]  
    inventory = inventory  
    private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_ansible  


Runing a few ad-hoc commnads to see if it's working  

    ansible all  -m ping # A ping pong test  
    ansible all --list-host # lists the hosts in the inventory file  
    ansible all -m gather_facts # reports facts about the hosts in the invetory file  
    ansible all -m gather_facts --limit nimbus102.sehlstedt.se # same as above but only for nimbus102  

# Part 5 - Runing elevated ad-hoc commands  
Note this requiers that the user on the remote server are allowed to use sudo.,e.g. belongs to the sudo group
Can be achived with following command as root on each server in the inventory list:  
    usermod -aG sudo username    

Now try following:  

    ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=true # Fails needs sudo  

The --become -> ask to sombody else.  
The --ask-become-pass -> ask for password e.g. sudo   

    ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=true --become --ask-become-pass # works  

Check /var/log/apt on a apointed server. To install packages:  

    ansible all -m apt -a name=vim-nox --become --ask-become-pass  
    ansible all -m apt -a name=tmux --become --ask-become-pass  

The above will install the packages if not already installed.  

    ansible all -m apt -a name=tmux --become --ask-become-pass  
The above will fail because tmux is already installed.  

    ansible all -m apt -a "name=tmux state=latest" --become --ask-become-pass  
The above will install lastest version if available and belongs to a "higher version"  
The below will upgrade to new version, if avaiable.  

    ansible all -m apt -a "upgrade=dist" --become --ask-become-pass  

# Part 06 - Writing your first playbook
Added support for install and remove apache. It also add php support for apache management.  
See files install_apache.yml and  remove_apache.yml   
# Part 07 - The 'when' conditional
Added Centos server and install of apache and php support for CentOS.  

The ansible when: statment can be rewritten as:  

    when: ansible_distribution in ["Debian", "Ubuntu"]  

to work for both distributions. Other variants are possible, e.g.

    when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS" and ansible_distribution_versions == "8.3"  

to pin point a specifict distribution and its version. In fact any variable from gather facts command,  

    ansible all -m gather_facts  

 can be used in logical expression as a when selector. Another example:  

    ansible all -m gather_facts --limit  nimbus105.sehlstedt.se | grep ansible_distribution  
        "ansible_distribution": "CentOS",  
        "ansible_distribution_file_parsed": true,  
        "ansible_distribution_file_path": "/etc/redhat-release",  
        "ansible_distribution_file_variety": "RedHat",  
        "ansible_distribution_major_version": "8",  
        "ansible_distribution_release": "NA",  
        "ansible_distribution_version": "8.3",  

Note:CentOS do not start the httpd servcie automatically or fix the firewall. I set up the CentOS as a container in proxmox, ANd had to separately add user and sudo, sudoers and openssh client and server and ssh keys. THe container used didn't have firewall so that was skipped. These things could of courser be automated as well.


# Part 08 - Improving your playbook
Reorganisation of playbook. The two playbooks, install_apache.yml and remove_apache.yml are refactored. To get that to work the the inventory file is changed as well to contain variable assignments per host that is used in the playbooks.   

# Part 09 - Targeting specific nodes (hosts)
Targeting specific nodes(hosts). Groupes of host is introduced in the inventory file.
A site.yml file was created that have tasks to be executed by all hostsand groups of task to excecuted of only by the hosts that belonged to the specific group. The groups introduced was web_servers, file_servers and db_servers.

Note the tasks in the hosts all section was changed to pre_task to ensure that this task is executed before the all other host section's tasks in the file.

Taks changethe inventory to contain the grouups definition and the host variables. To get the remove_apache work again. Also chnaged the site.yml to enable an start the httpd service on CentOS machines.

# Part 10 - Tags
Added tags to site.yml inorder to not run all task.  

    ansible-playbook --list-tags site.yml  

Lists available tags in a playbook named site.yml

To run task that are marked with a tag use:  

    ansible-playbook --tags centos --ask-become-pass site.yml  

To run task that are marked with  tags use:  

    ansible-playbook --tags "centos,web_server" --ask-become-pass site.yml  


# Part 11 - Managing Files

Created a default_site.html file in a new subdirectory called files and created a new task under web servers that copied the default_site.html file to /var/www/html/index.html on the webservers and assing owner and grouop to root and change the file mode to 0644.  

The subdirectory files is a default directory for the ansible copy module.

Created a new group called workstations were two task were created. The first task install
the unzip package which is needed by the ansible unarchive module. The second task use the unarchive module to fetch a zipfile from the internet, e.g. the terraform, see url:
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html  
 for current download links. Then ansible unzip this file to /usr/local/bin and change group and ownership and file mode.  

Finaly the the hosts in the worksations group was added to the inventory file.   
Note that the ansible public ssh key was added to the workstations before the playbok was used.  

# Part 12 - Managing services
The ansible module service was introduced  to start a service. There is also an systemd  module. Further more module lineinfile was introduced and the register statement to demonstrate how to  only run when a change was made. Note the variable used in the register statement is a toggle thus using is twice is  a bad idea because that is interpreted as no change.  

 Also be observant on the lineinfile statement may result in multiple chnages when the playbook is executed again, thus erronous changes will be performed and conditional task may be executed again.  

# Part 13 - Adding users and bootstrapping
Added simone user, bootstrap script, and separated bootstrap task from site.yml into bootstrap.yml.  
Also added ssh key for user simone to all machines in inventory.

ansible.cfg was update as well

Running bootstrap requiers password, e.g.  

    ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass bootstrap.yml  

Then run  

    ansible-playbook site.yml

# Part 15 - Host variables and handlers

# Part 16 - Series finale - templates
